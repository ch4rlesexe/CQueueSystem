# CQueueSystem

CQueueSystem is a dynamic queue management and server scaling plugin for **BungeeCord (1.8)** networks using **Pterodactyl**. It automatically queues players, starts servers on demand, and gracefully shuts them down when empty. Perfect for minigames, events, or lobbies that need responsive scaling without manual intervention.

Built for **Java 8** and **Minecraft 1.8 BungeeCord**.

## ‚úÖ Features

* **Smart player queue system** with FIFO logic
* **Auto-start and shutdown** of servers via Pterodactyl Client API
* **Single-server and pool support**
* **Live server capacity checks**
* **Optional Spigot integration** using a dedicated addon
* **Color-coded messages** and full config customization
* **Handles full servers with gradual player connection**

## üì¶ Requirements

* BungeeCord (1.8+) with plugin support
* Java 8
* Pterodactyl panel with **Client API keys**
* (Optional) Spigot plugin support via [CQueueSystemAddon](https://github.com/ch4rlesexe/CQueueSystemAddon)

## üîå Spigot Bridge Addon

To support NPCs, GUIs (e.g. DeluxeHub), or Spigot-side commands that trigger queueing on the BungeeCord proxy, install the Spigot-side addon:

üëâ **[CQueueSystemAddon GitHub Repo](https://github.com/ch4rlesexe/CQueueSystemAddon)**

This communicates over a registered plugin messaging channel and allows players to join or leave queues using in-game triggers or GUI actions.
